  Hi there! Welcome.
---

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

Like you, I wear a lot of hats. Most of the time, I’m a husband, dad, professor, and foodie.  
Perhaps we have some things in common.

### I like technical things
By training, I’m a microeconomic theorist. I studied economic statistics, operations research, and game theory at school.  My professional career has bounced between management consulting and academia.  Both careers involve teaching and problem solving, which I enjoy very much. Right now, academia gives me a wonderful mixture of autonomy to explore, learn new things, and still do [a little bit of consulting](../dlab).

### I teach a lot
I teach classes in operations research, decision analysis, finance, data analytics, game theory, behavioral economics, and microeconomic theory. My students think I’m a bit of a tyrant. I think I’m an idealist :)

### I am food motivated
Don’t tell anyone but I can be bribed with pizza, ramen, fried chicken, or even a good cup of coffee. I love Asian food but there isn't nearly enough in my town.

### I’m a complicated mixture of cultures
I’m ethnically Filipino but I’ve never lived in the Philippines. Actually, I grew up in Australia and still think of the lovely city of Brisbane as my hometown. Most of my working life is in the US and I’ve lived on the East Coast, Mid-West, and on the West Coast. It’s all a bit of a complicated mess in my mind.  I suppose I'm always wondering where I belong.
