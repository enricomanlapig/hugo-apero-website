## About

This talk brings the broad methods of data science/analytics into conversation with Decision Quality.  It was written and delivered for the developers at the [*Center for Applied Technology*](https://www.westmont.edu/center-applied-technology
) at [Westmont College](https://www.westmont.edu/). The session included live examples/illustrations that are not included in the deck.  The actual deck was a little bit different to this one but I wanted to try out the Xaringan slide format.
