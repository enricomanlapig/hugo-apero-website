Hello!  Welcome to my little corner of the Internet. I'm glad you're here.  Please feel free to have a look around.  

Creating this site was one of my sabbatical goals and something I've wanted and needed to do for a long while. I'm grateful for some time to invest in it.  

This page of *Noodlings* is what I think of as a kidn of *digital garden*.  I was introduced to this idea after attending a keynote by [Vicky Boykis](https://veekaybee.github.io/) at [RStudio Global](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/).  [Her talk](https://youtu.be/E5ERSfydB30) was wonderfully thoughtful, filled with reflections on her own experience, and practical ideas for getting started.  After sharing my page on Twitter, I even more about the [history and ethos of digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

To this end, I don't expect this page to be filled with polished prose or finished pieces.  Like a garden, I expect it to be more organic.  It will hopefully have little pots of ideas and beginnings as well as bins for things I learn, do, and care about.  Since I have broad interests, I suspect it won't be as focused as a conventional blog. That's okay with me.  I'll do what I can to keep things organized into categories (like garden beds). Let's try to keep expectations, yours and mine, low. ðŸ˜‰


Finally, please know that the thoughts I share are my own.
